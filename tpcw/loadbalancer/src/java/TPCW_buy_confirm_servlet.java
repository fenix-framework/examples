* TPCW_buy_confirm_servlet.java - Servlet Class implements the buy

*
* CAVEAT: This servlet does not fully adhere to the TPC-W
*         specification for the buy confirm web interaction, in that
*         it does not communicate with an external payment getway
*         emulator.

//DATABASE CONNECTIVITY NEEDED: Lots!
//1. Given a SHOPPING_ID, I need a way to get the SCL_ID, SC_COST, and 
//   SC_QTY for each item in the shopping cart, as well as the SC_SUBTOTAL,
//   SC_TAX, SC_SHIP_COST, and SC_TOTAL for the entire cart.
//
//2. Given a C_ID, I need a DB call that returns the C_FNAME, C_LNAME,
//   C_DISCOUNT, and C_ADDR_ID from the customer table. 
//
//3. I need a function which takes, as parameters, STREET_1, STREET_2, CITY,
//   STATE, ZIP, and COUNTRY. The DB code should search the ADDRESS table for
//   and address which matches these parameters. If one does not exist,
//   a new row is added to the ADDRESS table with these parameters as columns.
//   The lookup and the insertion must happen in a single DB transaction
//   This is described in section 2.7.3.2


//4. I also need a DB function which does what is described in section 
//   2.7.3.3, given the following parameters: C_ID, SC_SUB_TOTAL, SC_TOTAL,
//   SHIPPING, C_ADDR_ID, and ADDR_ID. This involves putting the order in
//   The ORDER DB table, creating a message to the SSL PGE (which is currently
//   never sent), putting an entry in the CC table, and then clearing all of
//   the items from the cart. This function should return the newly created
//   unique O_ID.
